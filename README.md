## Overview
This repository presents an experimental comparison of Tabu Search and
Genetic Algorithm approaches for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open `notebooks/TSP_experiments.ipynb`
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Results
The notebook includes convergence plots, scalability experiments,
robustness analysis based on multiple runs, and a statistical comparison
of algorithm performance.
